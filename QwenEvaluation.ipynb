KenKen puzzle, we need to fill in the grid such that each row and each column contains the numbers 1 through 7 (since the grid is 7x7). Each cage has a target number and an arithmetic operation, and the numbers within the cage must satisfy that operation to reach the target.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process to solve the puzzle:\\n\\n1. **Identify the cages and their operations:**\\n   - Top-left cage: \\\\(11+\\\\)\\n   - Top-middle cage: \\\\(3+\\\\)\\n   - Top-right cage: \\\\(8+\\\\)\\n   - Middle-left cage: \\\\(2\\\\times\\\\)\\n   - Middle-right cage: \\\\(1-\\\\)\\n   - Bottom-left cage: \\\\(3\\\\div\\\\)\\n\\n2. **Fill in the cages with the given numbers:**\\n   - The top-left cage \\\\(11+\\\\) must sum to 11. Possible pairs are (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6).\\n   - The top-middle cage \\\\(3+\\\\) must sum to 3. Possible pairs are (1, 2).\\n   - The top-right cage \\\\(8+\\\\) must sum to 8. Possible pairs are (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4).\\n   - The middle-left cage \\\\(2\\\\times\\\\) must multiply to 2. Possible pairs are (1, 2).\\n   - The middle-right cage \\\\(1-\\\\) must subtract to 1. Possible pairs are (2, 1).\\n   - The bottom-left cage \\\\(3\\\\div\\\\) must divide to 3. Possible pairs are (3, 1).\\n\\n3. **Place the numbers in the grid while ensuring no repetition in rows and columns:**\\n\\nLet's start by placing the numbers:\\n\\n- Place 1 in the top-middle cage since it's the only pair that sums to 3.\\n- Place 2 in the top-middle cage.\\n- Place 2 in the middle-left cage since it's the only pair that multiplies to 2.\\n- Place 1 in the middle-right cage since it's the only pair that subtracts to 1.\\n- Place 3 in the bottom-left cage since it's the only pair that divides to 3.\\n\\nNow, let's place the remaining numbers:\\n\\n- The top-left cage \\\\(11+\\\\) must be (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6). Since 1 and 2 are already used, possible pairs are (4, 7), (5, 6).\\n- The top-right cage \\\\(8+\\\\) must be (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4). Since 1 and 2 are already used, possible pairs are (3, 5), (4, 4).\\n- The bottom-right cage \\\\(1-\\\\) must be (2, 1).
