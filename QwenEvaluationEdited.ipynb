For a given cage, all of the numbers that will make up that cage must arrive at the target number through the arithmetic operator.

Each cage has a target number and an arithmetic operation, and the numbers within the cage must satisfy that operation to reach the target.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process to solve the puzzle:\\n\\n1. **Identify the cages and their operations:**\\n   - Top-left cage: \\\\(11+\\\\)\\n   - Top-middle cage: \\\\(3+\\\\)\\n   - Top-right cage: \\\\(8+\\\\)\\n   - Middle-left cage: \\\\(2\\\\times\\\\)\\n   - Middle-right cage: \\\\(1-\\\\)\\n   - Bottom-left cage: \\\\(3\\\\div\\\\)\\n\\n2. **Fill in the cages with the given numbers:**\\n   - The top-left cage \\\\(11+\\\\) must sum to 11. Possible pairs are (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6).\\n   - The top-middle cage \\\\(3+\\\\) must sum to 3. Possible pairs are (1, 2).\\n   - The top-right cage \\\\(8+\\\\) must sum to 8. Possible pairs are (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4).\\n   - The middle-left cage \\\\(2\\\\times\\\\) must multiply to 2. Possible pairs are (1, 2).\\n   - The middle-right cage \\\\(1-\\\\) must subtract to 1. Possible pairs are (2, 1).\\n   - The bottom-left cage \\\\(3\\\\div\\\\) must divide to 3. Possible pairs are (3, 1).\\n\\n3. **Place the numbers in the grid while ensuring no repetition in rows and columns:**\\n\\nLet's start by placing the numbers:\\n\\n- Place 1 in the top-middle cage since it's the only pair that sums to 3.\\n- Place 2 in the top-middle cage.\\n- Place 2 in the middle-left cage since it's the only pair that multiplies to 2.\\n- Place 1 in the middle-right cage since it's the only pair that subtracts to 1.\\n- Place 3 in the bottom-left cage since it's the only pair that divides to 3.\\n\\nNow, let's place the remaining numbers:\\n\\n- The top-left cage \\\\(11+\\\\) must be (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6). Since 1 and 2 are already used, possible pairs are (4, 7), (5, 6).\\n- The top-right cage \\\\(8+\\\\) must be (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4). Since 1 and 2 are already used, possible pairs are (3, 5), (4, 4).\\n- The bottom-right cage \\\\(1-\\\\) must be (2, 1). Since 1 is already used, possible pairs are not valid here.\\n\\nAfter trying different combinations and ensuring no repetition, we get the following solution:\\n\\n```python\\n[[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7],\\n [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4, 6],\\n [3, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 5],\\n [2, 6, 1, 5, 7, 3, 4],\\n [6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 7, 2],\\n [7, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 1],\\n [1, 4, 7, 2, 8, 5, 3]]\\n```\\n\\nThis is one possible solution to the given KenKen puzzle.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Qwen Mini 3x3 Results: \\nAccuracy: \", qwen_accuracy[3], \"%\\nAverage Time: \", qwen_avg_time[3], \"s\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"39v1yGJ9QR8_","outputId":"89cb6910-ea3a-420d-904b-65b0a6bf1150"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Qwen Mini 3x3 Results: \n","Accuracy:  10 %\n","Average Time:  26.58244123697281 s\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Qwen Mini 4x4 Results: \\nAccuracy: \", qwen_accuracy[4], \"%\\nAverage Time: \", qwen_avg_time[4], \"s\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jSP6xUFHs6Zz","outputId":"8b724e5e-7d34-42e7-fa31-37b0cf53cf0e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Qwen Mini 4x4 Results: \n","Accuracy:  0 %\n","Average Time:  35.20106599092483 s\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["qwen_avg_time[4] = qwen_avg_time[4] / 100"],"metadata":{"id":"yFxiUntHs-el"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"gERi_LbfQHay"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["results = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'accuracy (%)': qwen_accuracy,\n","    'avg_time (s)': qwen_avg_time\n","})"],"metadata":{"id":"lSn73kDxQLxq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["results.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Summer2025Research/SolverRepo/results/qwen_evaluation.csv', index=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"tOWjGAygQbC_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
